## Introduction
State-space models are well suited for time-series data and allow estimating the hidden states of the system from imperfect observations.
In some applications, the hidden state is known to be within a specific domain. Therefore, it can be useful to apply state constraints on the state vector components.\
An example application, is given the system state at time $t$, where 

$$0\le x_t \le 10$$

. State constraints can be imposed through the PDF Truncation Method proposed by Simon et. al [ref].\
